# sudoku-generator-and-solver

can generate a new sudoku puzzle and solve it. The number of open spots can also be changed in the main files for both the C++ and Java version.
the code may only be compiled and run in a linux environment

# if you dont want to compile on your device and want a quick run click here:
1. (easy)java: https://onlinegdb.com/2zbOA9wfL (click the run button in order to run the file)
2. (easy)c++ : https://onlinegdb.com/MZjAj-l8b (click the run button in order to run the file)
3. (fairly complex) java: https://iwdldxmrzkio-dtp.na.app.codingrooms.com *commands below*
4. (faily complex) c++: https://pglzlkithnxi-dtp.na.app.codingrooms.com *commands below*

*to run this you will see a white bar at the bottom of the page, with small icons towards the left. Hover on the icon that looks like a computer. It should display the word "terminal". Click on that icon then a terminal will show up. When the terminal shows up, you can run these commands:*

*make (compile all the files)*

*make run (run the compiled files)*

*make clean (delete the compiled files))*

*make vangaurd - checks for memory leaks and reports if any are found (c++ command)*

*make gdb - opens up the gdb debugging tool in the terminal (c++ command)*

*make jdb - opens up the jdb debugging tool in the terminal (java command)*

# to run this code you will need to install:

# to run the code:

1. open a terminal in the directory where the file is located, so if you wanted to test run the c++ version, you would open a terminal in a directory like so: "parent_directory/child_directory/c++"
2. type in the command make to compile the files
3. type in the command make run to run the files
4. type in make clean to clear out compilation files after running

# shared commands

1. make - compiles files
2. make run - runs the compiled files
3. make clean - cleans out the compiled files

# c++ commands
1. make vangaurd - checks for memory leaks and reports if any are found
2. make gdb - opens up the gdb debugging tool in the terminal

# java commands
1. make jdb - opens up the jdb debugging tool in the terminal
